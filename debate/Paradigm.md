# Paradigm
## Experience
I debated all four years of high school and held leadership positions for three of those years. Now, I help coach varsity debaters at a local high school.

## General Preferences
SIGNPOST!!! I really need to hear (at a normal or slightly fast pace) which argument to flow on, which cards are being argued against, and the tag and cite for the card. Also, I generally expect to hear "AND" between cards and "NEXT" between arguments; this both helps delineate between flowing on one argument and flowing a new argument and models more formal logics and rhetorical structures. For anything else, spread to your heart’s desire! I find that signposting helps the teams understand each other and facilitates clash, as well as eliminating confusion for the judge. _I usually vote tech over truth, but a good argument should have both._ Speaking points are a separate part of the ballot for a reason; better arguments win the ballot and better speaking wins the points. Similarly, logos wins the ballot, pathos wins speaker points, and ethos can help both. Extensions are important, but if both teams drop a line I will default to having the most recent argument win the flow. Also, new arguments can be read in the 2NC and new cards can be read in the rebuttals. _If there is a SpeechDrop or something similar, I'd prefer to have access so I can flow better. I default to allowing the neg to not be internally consistent, but I hold that the aff should be._

## Specific Arguments
Framework is everything for me; it can override every preference that I have except for my position on signposting and spreading. _I am tabula rasa but default to stock issues with emphasis on S and T (my favorite argument as a novice)._ I have experience with high theory (i.e. a couple dozen rounds junior year at Kansas 5/6A State and most of my senior year) and it will earn you bonus points because I think it's fun. Beyond that, I study and frequently read philosophy, so there's a good chance that I've read the source material for a some of the big names like Marx and Heidegger._Condo isn’t usually a big deal for me._
  
### Significance, Inherency, and Harms
These are basically the same for me and are almost never a voting issue.

### Topicality
Can be a time sink and quite annoying, but can also be done very well. I have to have a full T argument to vote on it. _I’m looking for interpretation, violation, standards, and voters._ Standards and voters can sometimes be combined, but should never be omitted. Also, don’t just say which standards or voters, but explain them.

### Specification
I generally find spec arguments to be the worst of the worst bad-faith time sink arguments. In my (strong) opinion, spec arguments tend to be T, if it didn't have any of the fun parts. That said, more theoretical arguments like A-Z spec can be very interesting. If the aff includes plan planks, there is basically no reason whatsoever to run any spec.

### Solvency
_This is the most important stock issue._ It can be included in the advantages, but should still be distinguished somehow.

### Advantages and Disadvantages
_I expect to see uniqueness, specific link, and impact_; internal links and solvency are on an as-needed basis. Do whatever string of cards you desire; policy debate is famous for nuclear war scenarios and I don't have an issue with that.

### Impact Turns
Please run an impact turn! All you have to do is explain your point better than the other team. My high school mentors did a lot of spark.

### Counterplans
I don’t really have any strong opinions here, except that I generally believe that _counterplans should have a net benefit_. PICs are fine, agent CPs are fine, etc.

### Kritiks
These are usually either the most annoying or the most interesting arguments for me. _A K that earns the ballot will have a specific link, impact, and alternative._ Preferably, if you run a K, you have a strong personal conviction on the topic. The best Ks that I ever debated against were a deep ecology K from someone now studying environmental law and a cap K by someone who experienced the worst of American healthcare. You will likely have to walk me through your authors, as I find that K debates can easily become quite confusing, especially if I’m not familiar with the authors or ideas.

### High Theory
_As long as you can explain it, anything goes!_ Basically, the only rules that I refuse to break are time rules and speech order. My high school specialized in “debate is bad” and performance FWs. I often ran a novelty in education FW that did quite well.

### Everything Else
I probably missed it because it’s not a big deal to me.

## Additional Sentiments
1. I don't like boring debates that are just case files argued the same way I've heard a thousand times. I judge tournaments every few weeks and am generally familiar with camp files, but I certainly don't know everything. That being said, I am pretty involved with things, so if you’re getting bored of it, I probably am too.
2. Most of all, make the round fun! Do something silly (with proper justification) and try to leave the round knowing more than when you came in! I think that debate is a game in which those involved get to both push the limits of logic itself and learn how reason can be a useful tool when used responsibly.
3. I will try to write good and well-structured ballots (I know how frustrating an empty ballot is), but if you want additional comments you can just ask me after the round or tournament. If you want any extra clarification on my paradigm, you can just ask before the round and I'll answer once both teams are present.
