## General Terms
**CX:** the debate format called cross-examination or policy.

**NSDA:** the National Speech and Debate Association. This is the larger organization that generally serves as the standard for high school speech and debate events and tournaments. It also encompasses an honor society. It partners with Tabroom and sometimes works with NAUDL, although they host different tournaments.

**Tabroom:** the website tabroom.com. This site hosts most of the balloting and tournament information for NSDA tournaments. It maintains records of judges, competitors, and coaches. An experienced judge's paradigm is usually found here.

**NAUDL:** the National Association of Urban Debate Leagues. This league offers tournaments for debate leagues in large cities.

**Paradigm:** the judge's debriefing. It usually contains the judge's experience and their opinion on specific arguments and their style preferences.

**Affirmative:** the team that is intended to affirm the resolution by presenting a plan for a policy. The way of doing so is also called the affirmative, aff, or case. The case contains a plan and may contain stock issues and advantages, which are called arguments.

**Resolution:** the topic of debate selected each year by the National Federation of State High School Associations. Resolutions tend to be written in a common format, which is exemplified by the resolution for academic year 2025-26: "Resolved: The United States federal government should significantly increase its exploration and/or development of the Arctic."

**Argument:** a major point that a team is attempting to prove. If flowing on paper, each argument usually gets its own page. Common arguments are: stock issues, advantages, CPs, disads, and Ks.

**Flowing:** the specialized way that debaters take notes. If using paper, each page should maintain a portrait orientation. Generally, each card or analytic takes up a space that is 1" wide and 1.5" tall, with about 0.5-1" of space between each, and is flowed vertically, in the column of the speech order to which it belongs. There are 8 speeches in a CX round, and letter- or legal-sized paper is 8.5" wide, so a full round should take up the width of the page. Some debaters choose to flow the neg block in a single column in order to reserve horizontal space by reducing vertical space.

**Negative:** the team that is intended to prove that the case is not better than the status quo. This team is also called the neg. The neg team is sometimes called the "masters of the squo."

**Card:** a piece of evidence. It contains the following three pieces, in the order shown:
- **Tag:** the summary of the minor point that the card is intended to show. This should be kept to a minimum, that is to say, it should rarely be more than three clauses long.
- **Cite:** the citation. Generally, only the author's last name and the year are read Including more details can help emphasize the author's ethos.
- **Warrant:** the body of text from the source material. There should be plenty of context to allow the judge and the other team to understand what the author meant.
