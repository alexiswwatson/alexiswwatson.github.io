# Debate Resources
This is a collection of my (real or imagined) knowledge, experiences, thoughts, and opinions on high school policy debate. Part of my motivation for this is to provide a centralized resource for my students, and another part is to disseminate information to which some people may not have access. I believe that debate should be equitable (i.e. everyone has equal access to resources, and their own interest can determine the rest). <br />
